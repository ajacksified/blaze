Blaze - Campfire web client
---------------------------
Blaze is an alternative to the standard campfire web client.

I decided to build it because the existing campfire web client was rather
clunky and outdated. It does full-page refreshes when changing tabs,
logs you out if you sit in the lobby tab for too long and doesnt support 
desktop notifications
