Blaze - Campfire web client
---------------------------
Blaze is an alternative to the standard campfire web client.

I decided to build it because the existing campfire web client was rather
clunky and outdated. It does full-page refreshes when changing tabs,
logs you out if you sit in the lobby tab for too long and doesnt support 
desktop notifications

Planned Features:
* ajax tabbed interface 
* configurable desktop notifications for active/inactive tabs
* drag/drop file upload 
* responsive interface - UI should adapt to size of the window. less important features (recent files etc) dropped if space is minimal
